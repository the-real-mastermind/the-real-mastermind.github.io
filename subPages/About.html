            <li>Game Development<br> I spend a lot of time developing and experimenting with the many ideas that float inside my head. Most of them never end up as finished projects</li>
            <br>
            <li>Networking<br> This is the most recent of my hobbies that I have gotten into, I enjoy testing and learning about linux web server technologies. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Model Kits<br> One of my favorite things to do for almost my entire life has been model kits (e.g., LEGO & Gunpla) I have an extensive collection and constantly adding to it </li>
            <br>
            <li>3D Printing<br> Several years ago I purchesed a 3D printer (Ender 3 V2 NEO) after learning to use one of my associates 3D printers, from there I have grown into creating a plethora of large models and small models alike (The majority of which are items found within the video games I play)  </li>
            <br>
            <li>Video games<br> As with most of the people my age I often find myself indulging in the act of playing video games, my favorite of which are (but not limited to) The Legend Of Zelda, Xenoblade chronicles, and Worldless. I also often enjoy playing through smaller indie games found on video game markets such as Steam.  </li>
            <br>
            <li>PC Building<br>Although it is rare that I get to enjoy this hobby I do still quite enjoy the thrill of putting together a new system, whether it be for me or an associate of myself. It is always an enjoyable experiance (PC specs listed below)</li>
